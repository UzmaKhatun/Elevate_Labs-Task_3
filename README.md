# 🏠 Airbnb Listing Analysis Project

This project analyzes Airbnb listing data to derive valuable insights, predict rental prices, and visualize important trends. It demonstrates data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and machine learning modeling.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The goal is to:
- Understand what factors affect Airbnb rental prices.
- Perform feature engineering on listing details like location, room type, amenities, etc.
- Build and evaluate regression models to predict the price of a listing.
- Create interactive dashboards (optional with Streamlit/Power BI) for visualization.

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset includes:
- `listing_id`: Unique ID for each Airbnb listing
- `name`: Title of the listing
- `neighbourhood_group`: Major city zones
- `neighbourhood`: Local neighborhood
- `latitude` / `longitude`: Location coordinates
- `room_type`: Type of room offered (Entire home, Private room, etc.)
- `price`: Price per night
- `minimum_nights`: Minimum nights required
- `number_of_reviews`, `reviews_per_month`, etc.

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- **Python**
- **Pandas, NumPy** – Data manipulation
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** – Visualization
- **Scikit-learn** – ML modeling

----

## 🔍 Key Steps

1. **Data Cleaning**
   - Handle missing values
   - Remove duplicates and outliers

2. **EDA**
   - Analyze price distribution
   - Understand correlations and feature importance

3. **Modeling**
   - Train/test split
   - Models used: Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost
   - Evaluate using RMSE, MAE

4. **Visualization**
   - Price vs location heatmaps
   - Distribution of room types by neighborhood
   - Model prediction plots
